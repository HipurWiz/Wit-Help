<h1 id="faq">FAQ</h1>
<p>These questions aren&#39;t really frequently asked but I&#39;m just going to predict what is asked.</p>
<p><strong>Why is the bot offline?</strong></p>
<p>Normally, you don&#39;t notice that the bot went offline. What happens is whatever minigame your in the middle of <strong>WILL CRASH</strong> and you have to start over. What also might have happened is that the host crashed and I have to go and get the bot online again. If it goes offline for an extended period of time, consider joining the Wit Support Server to let me know or to see if anything happened that required me to take the bot down.</p>
<p><strong>What is the support server link?</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.discord.gg/jdWBAcyzeA">Server Link!</a></p>
<p><strong>How come some people have better luck on commands?</strong></p>
<p>There are two possibilities for this. First, they might just have extremely good luck. The more likely possibility, is that they voted. Vote for Wit here: <a href="https://top.gg/bot/907067389806522450/vote">Go Vote!</a>.</p>
